# VAE
This is the quick implementation of VAE for generating MNIST images.

The code is written inspired by VAE implementation in https://github.com/L1aoXingyu/pytorch-beginner/blob/master/08-AutoEncoder/Variational_autoencoder.py

The advantage of VAE in comparison to GAN is its smoothness to generate the samples from the Gaussian noise


First train the model by running train.py

Then generate the samples by running test.py
